/* The happy path for an append request is:
 *
 * - If there is a current segment and it is has enough spare capacity to hold
 *   the entries in the request, then queue the request, linking it to the
 *   current segment.
 *
 * - If there is no current segment, or it hasn't enough spare capacity to hold
 *   the entries in the request, then request a new open segment to be prepared,
 *   queue the request and link it to the newly requested segment.
 *
 * - Wait for any pending write against the current segment to complete, and
 *   also for the prepare request if we asked for a new segment. Also wait for
 *   any in progress barrier to be removed.
 *
 * - Submit a write request for the entries in this append request. The write
 *   request might contain other append requests targeted to the current segment
 *   that might have accumulated in the meantime, if we have been waiting for a
 *   segment to be prepared, or for the previous write to complete or for a
 *   barrier to be removed.
 *
 * - Wait for the write request to finish and fire the append request's
 *   callback.
 *
 * Possible failure modes are:
 *
 * - The request to prepare a new segment fails.
 * - The write request fails.
 * - The request to finalize a new segment fails to be submitted.
 *
 * In all these cases we mark the instance as errored and fire the relevant
 * callbacks.
